## CJDNS
Cjdns (Caleb James DeLisle's Network Suite) is a networking protocol and reference implementation. It is founded on the ideology that networks should be easy to set up, protocols should scale smoothly, and security should be built in by default.

CJDNS uses cryptography to self-assign IPv6 address in the fc00::/8 subnet and will automatically peer with other nodes connected via Layer2 ethernet, broadcasts or configured UDP tunnels.

For more information please see the [CJDNS FAQ](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/faq/general.md).

To modify the ports that are accessable from CJDNS modify the `cjdns` *table* in the IPv6 firewall config file. See the [**Firewall**](#firewall) section for more details.

## Yggdrasil
Yggdrasil is another piece of mesh routing software similar to CJDNS, but with potentially better performance and more active development. For more info visit the [website](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io).

### Yggdrasil subnetting

Yggdrasil will give each node (like your Pi, for example) an IPv6 address, but it can also give each node a subnet to distribute to its clients. This means that if you connect to the WiFi of your Pi, your device can get a unique Yggdrasil address, with all the benefits it provides. These include being able to access your device directly, without being NATed or blocked.

However, the Pi does have a firewall, so various commands need be run to allow access to clients. By default all Yggdrasil client access is blocked. See [**Firewall/IPv6/Yggdrasil Clients**](#yggdrasil-clients) to learn how to change that.

## IPFS
IPFS stands for Interplanetary File System. It is an open-source, peer-to-peer distributed hypermedia protocol that aims to function as a ubiquitous file system for all computing devices. 

This module will install IPFS under the user where the script runs allowing you to access IPFS resouces both directly from the command line, and through the gateway available at <Pi IP Address>/ipfs/
  
## Firewall
  
The firewall module installes a basic firewall for your device. It will block all ports that were not meant to be open. By default there are no ports blocked from the Wireless Access Point interface (`wlan-ap`).

### Applying changes
After making any changes to files as outlined below, run `sudo systemctl restart hostapd` to apply the changes. This will take down the Pi's WiFi for a moment, but it will come back up on it's own. SSH sessions will freeze, but should reconnect on their own as well.

### IPv4
Default open ports to the device are below. Since both CJDNS and Yggdrasil use IPv6, these ports are open only for LAN or WiFi usage.

| Port | Protocol | Policy | Description               |
| :---- | :------ | :----- | :------------------------ |
| 67:68 | UDP     | Accept | DHCP Client/Server        |
| 22    | UDP     | Accept | SSH                       |
| 53    | TCP/UDP | Accept | DNS Server                |
| 80    | TCP     | Accept | HTTP                      |
| 443   | TCP     | Accept | SSH                       |
| 8008  | TCP/UDP | Accept | SSB                       |
| 9100  | TCP     | Accept | NodeExporter              |
| 9090  | TCP     | Accept | Prometheus Server         |
| 3000  | TCP     | Accept | Grafana                   |
| 5201  | TCP     | Accept | IPerf3                    |
| 4001  | TCP     | Accept | IPFS Swarm port           |

#### Change open ports

To change the open ports you can edit the IPv4 configuration file located at `/etc/iptables/rules.v4`

Remove or comment out (`#`) the lines of the ports that you wish to close and add new lines for additional ports you wish to open.

Likely you will not need to edit this file as much, if you are interested in opening mesh ports look at the **IPv6** section directly below.

These are standard `iptables` rules. The basic syntax is as follows:

`-A INPUT -j ACCEPT -p <protocol> --dport <port>`

`protocol` -  either `tcp` or `udp`, not required but recommended

`port` - Port you wish to open between 1-65535


### IPv6

Default open ports to the device over IPv6 are

| Port | Protocol | Policy | Description               |
| :---- | :------ | :----- | :------------------------ |
| 67:68 | UDP     | Accept | DHCP Client/Server        |
| 22    | UDP     | Accept | SSH                       |
| 53    | TCP/UDP | Accept | DNS Server                |
| 80    | TCP     | Accept | HTTP                      |
| 443   | TCP     | Accept | SSH                       |
| 5201  | TCP     | Accept | IPerf3                    |
| 4001  | TCP     | Accept | IPFS Swarm port           |
| 8008  | TCP/UDP | Accept | SSB                       |
| 9100  | TCP     | Accept | NodeExporter              |

#### Change open ports

To change the open ports you can edit the IPv6 configuration file located at `/etc/iptables/rules.v6`

Remove or comment out (#) the lines of the ports that you wish to close and add new lines for additional ports you wish to open.

These are standard `ip6tables` rules. The basic syntax is as follows:

`-A <table> -j ACCEPT -p <protocol> --dport <port>`

`table` - `CJDNS` or `YGGDRASIL` for opening the port to CJDNS or YGGDRASIL, `YGGCLIENT` for opening up access to [**Yggdrasil Clients**](#yggdrasil-clients), and `INPUT` to open the port up to all of IPv6.

`protocol` -  either `tcp` or `udp`, not required but recommended

`port` - Port you wish to open between 1-65535

Make sure to put your rules in the right section of the file, there are different ones depending on the table, with comments defining each section.

#### Yggdrasil Clients

Below are some different scenarios for opening up Yggdrasil clients. You will need to put these rules in `/etc/iptables/rules.v6`, in the Yggdrasil client rules section indicated by a comment.

 - **One client, one port**

Doing this is not recommended, as Yggdrasil clients IP addresses may change.

 - **All clients, one port**

`-A YGGCLIENT -j ACCEPT -p <PROTOCOL> --dport <PORT>`

Specifying a protocol is not required, but recommended.

- **All clients, all ports**

`-A YGGCLIENT -j ACCEPT`

If you use this rule, there is no point in having any other Yggdrasil client rules in the file.

You can specify a protocol, but that would limit the ports that are open.

## Adding deprecated.systems peer info into CJDNS and Yggdrasil (Optional)

#### CJDNS

Go to [Deprecated Systems](https://deprecated.systems/) website. You will see the following information:

```
cjdns peering

    "159.203.5.91:30664": {
      "peerName": "deprecated.systems",
      "login": "tomesh-public",
      "password": "iuw4nklm3j89qno876ef2jabpvlg1j0",
      "publicKey": "2scyvybg4qqms1c5c9nyt50b1cdscxnr6ycpwsxf6pccbmwuynk0.k"
    }

    "[2604:a880:cad:d0::45:d001]:30664": {
      "peerName": "deprecated.systems",
      "login": "tomesh-public",
      "password": "iuw4nklm3j89qno876ef2jabpvlg1j0",
      "publicKey": "2scyvybg4qqms1c5c9nyt50b1cdscxnr6ycpwsxf6pccbmwuynk0.k"
    }
```

This is the peering information that will give you the address (ipv4 or ipv6) and credntials to connect to 
the node. You must either select to use just the ipv4 config, or you could use both. Now that we have this info, 
connect to your mesh device, and edit the following config file:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/cjdroute.conf
```

This file contains everything that is required for cjdns to run, so be careful not to remove anything else, unless
you know what you are doing. you need to head down to this line:

```
// Nodes to connect to (IPv4 only).
"connectTo":
{
```

This is where you input the ipv4 address. there is also a ipv6 field:

```
// Nodes to connect to (IPv6 only).
"connectTo": 
{
```

Insert the respective code, and the save (ctrl+X to save, then ctrl+S to confirm file name, then ENTER to confrim changes).
your code should look somwhat like this:
```
                // Nodes to connect to (IPv4 only). 
                "connectTo":
                 {
                               "159.203.5.91:30664": {
                                 "peerName": "deprecated.systems",
                                 "login": "tomesh-public",
                                 "password": "iuw4nklm3j89qno876ef2jabpvlg1j0",
                                 "publicKey": "2scyvybg4qqms1c5c9nyt50b1cdscxnr6ycpwsxf6pccbmwuynk0.k"
                               }
                 }
```

Next you should restart cjdns with a `sudo systemctl restart cjnds` command. this will reload cjdns
with the new config file. run a `status` command on your node, and make sure when it prints out
the text, that cjdns is green with the text `[ACTIVE]`. if so, you have succesfully connected to the remote peer,
if it says `[INACTIVE]`, then there might be a typo in your config file. make sure its formatted correctly (the
config file is written using JSON).

### Yggdrasil

To connect to the "Deprecated Systems" node via Yggdrasil, you must do the similar as above, but with qutie a few less steps.

On the [deprecated.systems](https://deprecated.systems/) website, there is a section outlining the info for Yggdrasil:

```
"104.248.104.141:59168"
"[2604:a880:cad:d0::45:d001]:59168"
```

One is ipv4, the other ipv6. Head over to your mesh node yet again, and enter the following in your terminal:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/yggdrasil.conf
```

We are interested in this section of the config file:

```
List of connection strings for static peers in URI format, e.g. tcp://a.b.c.d:e or socks://a.b.c.d:e/f.g.h.i:j.
Peers: []
```

This is where we are going to enter in the info to connect to the peer node. Your code should look similar to this:

```
Peers: ["tcp://104.248.104.141:59168"]
```

Exit out of nano and save the changes. restart Yggdrasil with a `sudo killall yggdrasil` command. pass a `status`
command to terminal and you should see green text where Yggdrasil is printed with the words `[ACTIVE]` present.
you are now connected to the remote peer with Yggdrasil. If you see`[INACTIVE]`, then you need to check your code
for typos, make sure there are "" around the whole entire string.
